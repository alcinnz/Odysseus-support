title: How do I find I page I've visited before.

Unfortunately you'll just have to retrace your steps as that feature is not supported yet. However there are plans drawn up and much of the underlying infrastructure has been sucessfully implemented. The design goal there is to make it easy to skim down the page to find exactly the page you're looking for. 

So while history isn't supported yet, Odysseus should reasonably soon have the best history viewer around!
