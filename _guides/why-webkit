title: Why does Odysseus use WebKit?
---

1. It's the easiest browser engine to use in an elementary application.
2. It's got modestly better integration into elementary OS.
3. It works very well, and is getting better.
4. Other elementary apps like Mail use it.

And it uses WebKit2 for significant security, performance, and web compatibility improvements.

Maybe these are weak arguments and a better case can be made for another engine (say, Servo), but they're strong enough for Odysseus to keep using WebKit for the foreseeable future.
