title: Why can't I watch Netflix?
---

Netflix takes measures to try and prevent any other use of their material other than watching their videos whilst they download. To do so they insist on running unaccountable (non-free) software on your device wasting your computation power just in case your up to no good. In the past they said they do this because the production companies (e.g. Disney, Warner Bros) require it of them, although Netflix was explicitly asked not to do so by the copyright holders of some of the movies they offer and despite largely making their own movies now. 

As such it takes extra effort to add support for Netflix (and other movie streaming sites), as that requires incorporating code (directly or indirectly) to police anyone watching their videos through Odysseus. Given more fundamental browser features are missing from Odysseus, this is at the bare bottom of my TODO-list. It also doesn't appear to be high on the TODO-list of the technology Odysseus uses to render webpages, WebKitGTK, as it currently has no support for it<sup title="So no support in Epiphany/GNOME Web either">1</sup>. 

Not only that but I (Adrian Cochrane) am morally opposed both to:

1. Running software on your computer I or any other independant person cannot review the source code for in case it has backdoors or other security problems
2. Restricting how you use your computer

It's a sad state of affairs that these morals only breaks most of the websites legally redistributing videos. So please [check out](https://vodo.net/) [legal services](https://vimeo.com/ondemand/) which do [respect these morals](https://cloud.blender.org/).
