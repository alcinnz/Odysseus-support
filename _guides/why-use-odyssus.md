## Why Use <i>Odysseus</i> Over The <i>elementary OS</i> Default "<i>Epiphany</i>", Or Other, Browser?

While <i>Epiphany</i> is a superb web browser, it was designed specifically for the <i>GNOME3</i> desktop rather than <i>elementary OS</i>'s desktop. As such it doesn't have the same uniform look and feel [all other built-in <i>elementary OS</i> builtin apps have](https://web.archive.org/web/20130119035803/http://elementaryos.org/journal/distros-platforms-and-where-we-fit). Odysseus does.

To put it another way: just as <i>Edge</i> is designed to be the best browser for <i>Microsoft Windows</i> and <i>Safari</i> is designed to be the best browser for <i>Mac OS X</i> & <i>iOS</i><sup title="And Epiphany is designed to be the perfect browser for GNOME3">1</sup>, <i>Odysseus</i> is designed to be the perfect browser for <i>elementary OS</i>.

So if you love <i>elementary OS</i>'s design and consistancy, you must get <i>Odysseus</i>!
