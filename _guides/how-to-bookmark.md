title: How do I bookmark a page?

Unfortunately that feature is not supported yet. However there are plans drawn up and much of the underlying infrastructure has been sucessfully implemented. The design goal there is to make it trivial to bookmark lots of sites whilst putting extremely little effort into organizing them. 

So while bookmarking isn't supported yet, Odysseus should reasonably soon have the best bookmarking system around!
