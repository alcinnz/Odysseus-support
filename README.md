# Odysseus Support

Having trouble with the Odysseus Web Browser for elementary OS? First check [the website/user guide](https://alcinnz.github.io/Odysseus-support/), and failing that check [this repository's issues](https://github.com/alcinnz/Odysseus-support/issues) or ask you're own question. 

If you want to help, feel free to answer other's questions and/or document the answers in the user guide. All you need to do so is knowledge of [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) and a Github account.
